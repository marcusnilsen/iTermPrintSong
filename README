 Print your currently playing song in Spotify/VLC/iTunes (on OSX) to IRC via iTerm2

 How to use:
       1. Save this file somewhere on your disk.
       2. Set up iTerm2 to run a coprocess:

               Preferences -> Keys -> Under 'Global Shortcut Key', bind a key:

               Add (+), Shortcut:              F5
                        Action:                Run Coprocess
                        Add script path:       python /path/to/showSong.py

       3. Pressing 'F5' in a Irssi window will print the song currently playing in to the channel.
